        %p I worked on the Public Transit challenge for my city of San Francisco. I decided to ideate on how to speed up public transit. SF is only 7 miles squared. But it can take an hour or more to cover a distance that can be covered in 15 minutes by private transit. Parking is very difficult and taxi/Lyft/Uber is expensive.
      #caption1b.grid-span.two-col.dark-on-light
        %p
          %span.emphasis So How might we get public transit in SF to approach the speed of private transit in SF?

      #caption2b.one-col
        %p I came up with about 34 ideas in about an hour long session. I think I got a good mix of crazy ideas and more practical ideas. And I think some of the crazy ideas have the potential to be scaled back to normal ideas.
      #caption5.one-col
        %p I actually find picking an idea to move forward more challenging than coming up with a bunch of ideas. I tend to want to explore a lot of ideas.
        %p I started the convergence process by clustering. I really enjoyed clustering because it simplifies things a lot. It's easier to keep a few clusters in your head versus 34 or more ideas. I feel like there's some potential in each cluster.

      #caption6.grid-span.dark-on-light
        %p These are my top ideas:
        %ul.dark-list
          %li Improve the bus routes (no left turns and less stops&#8212;there are a lot of redundant stops on some lines)
          %li Instead of banning cars which is ridiculous, maybe there are car free hours/zones
          %li I think adding some aerial transit could be a great improvement
          %li Improving transfers
          %li Bus vehicle modification such as open buses for faster boarding

      #caption7.one-col
        %p After spending a little more time thinking about aerial transit options, I decided to head above street level by looking at what it would be like if there was a network of aerial Gondolas like they have a ski resorts.
      #caption8.one-col
        %p Larger trips in and out of the city would continue on the rail system, but they'd then be able to transfer once they got into the city to take gondolas to specific destinations. For those that live and work inside the city, people would use them to get from their hilly neighborhoods down to the commercial districts to shop, work, and eat. People would also be able to go to other neighborhoods and no longer be confined to their own.

      #caption9.one-col
        %p I went rummaging around my house trying to figure out what to make everything out of. I remembered I had this map of San Francisco so I decided to lay everything out on there. I thought about using paper clips for the hooks of the gondolas and floss for the lines. But then I found a sewing kit. I didn't have any foam to put the pins in, so I found this cardboard, cut it into pieces. Then I taped them one by one down where I thought stations might go.
      #caption9b.one-col
        %p
          I knew that it would be more dense toward downtown (the upper right quadrant) and fan out from there. I decided to go with 20 stations. Once I did that, I used my knowledge of existing routes and flows people take through the city to at least put together some rough "lines" to travel on. Not intended to be final of course. Then I took a bunch of shots from different angles. Some overhead for a clear overview, but some down low from the side to make it feel more like you're in the city.
      #caption10.one-col-dark.dark-on-light
        %p I came up with a prototype of 20 different cardboard stations on it with strings connecting them. This could give us a rough idea of what the lines might be and what density we might need.
      .grid-span.two-col
        %p
          %span I really wanted to learn, is the gondola solution on the right track? Could it work at all? What challenges might I encounter and what improvements could I make to make it work?
      .grid-span.dark-on-light
        %p My wife suggested:
        %ul.dark-list
          %li The "lines" should loop around so they can add more gondolas based on demand.
          %li There should be many more stations! (this got me thinking about the extreme a grid of wires that basically matched the city street grid and they could swap just like those cameras at football games).
          %li Stops at the top and base of hills.
          %li Some scenic routes along the coast for funding help.
          %li Transfer points are key.
          %li Stations at the edge of the city.
          %li People should be able to get bikes on.
      #caption11.grid-span.two-col-extra
        %p I also got another suggestion in my learning circle to look into aerial cable car systems. This is something I'll have to investigate further.
        %p I got some quality feedback from my wife who obviously knows the city and it's transit problems well. I think showing her the map and the stations really helped start a dialog and I'm not sure I would've gotten all the feedback without a prototype.
        %p I do think some other prototypes will be helpful for different aspects. Like what do these gondolas look like? How might the stations integrate with the environment?
        %p I think there would be a lot of value in ideating/prototyping with a group of individuals from many disciplines but including people who know about city planning, public transit, and engineering. So far I've mostly tackled this myself with a little help here and there. I think I could take it much further if I had a group like this.

      %div
        %p It's a bit of chicken and egg between the questions "Can this be done?" and "Does anyone want this?" But with my first 4, I really thought it's best to answer "Can this be done?" first because there are cities that have done systems like this so I think there's a way in which the system could be desirable in San Francisco. But I think figuring out the constraints around feasibility/viability will help design a system around the feasibility.
      %figure.image.contain.fourSeventyTwo{"aria-label" => "", :role => "img", :style => "background-image: url(#{"/images/ita-order.jpg"})"}
      .two-col.grid-span.dark-on-light
        %p I decided to iterate around the question I think to be the most important How will stations be built throughout the city? San Francisco is pretty jam packed. There's not a lot of open space for development.
      .grid-span.two-col-extra
        %p Researching urban gondolas, the stations look fairly big. But I am thinking there could be two types of stations. The big ones where the gondolas need to turn around and can be added/taken off the line, and possibly some smaller stations which are just "stops" where people can get off and on. With these smaller stations there can be a much denser network of gondolas throughout the city.
        %p I think that there might be a good combination of different solutions to complete the network. In the downtown area, I think utilizing the skyscrapers is key. Whether it's on top of or between buildings isn't as much of an issue as in the residential areas. But utilizing other infrastructure like highways and reservoirs and areas of the city at the extremities that are more industrial to fit the turnaround stations I think will really help out.
        %p I really liked the idea of being able to use the light rail platforms which are raised slightly. Some sort of mechanism for the gondolas to lower down to these or other platforms would really make it slick. if that doesn't work, then we'll have to go over the street or on top of buildings. And I think this will really limit the number of places riders can get on and off of.
      %figure.image.contain.fourSeventyTwo{"aria-label" => "", :role => "img", :style => "background-image: url(#{"/images/ita-pulley.png"})"}
      .one-col
        %p Next I would like to prototype a "Dip-Down" stop to see how it might work. I'm thinking I would make a little raised platform out of cardboard (with stairs and a ramp) and a sidewalk out of cardboard as well to see how it might fit in that space.
        %p Using fishing line and maybe some wooden spools or something that could act as a pulley.
      .two-col.grid-span.dark-on-light
        %p After doing a quick small scale prototype, I think it would be quite useful to make a larger prototype of a gondola built out of plywood and plexiglass. The station itself I imagine to be like the length of a bus.
      .one-col
        %p After going through the cycle of Ideate, Prototype, Iterate, I made a presentation based on the work that I had done.
