        %h3 How might an online platform help parents compare relevant preschools?
        %p I decided to create a tool to help parents find preschools that work with their daily commute.
        %p This a launching point from which they can compare other criteria that are important to them.

        %h3 I began with a simple flow to show the user which preschools could work logistically.
        %p The landing page asks the user for home and work addresses. Then they are presented with a results page. Each school has a more detailed view where they can apply or contact the school.

      .one-col
        %h3 I designed a form for users to input relevant addresses to their daily commute.
        %p I've included work addresses for each parent, as well as an additional caretaker. Knowing how the parents commute is also important in finding schools that work.
      .one-col
        %h3 Then, I created the landing page around the form.
        %p My aim was to direct the users attention toward the form. I used some copy to help explain what the tool does. I wanted the visual elements to help emphasize that this is for preschools without being distracting.

        %h3 When interacting with the prototype, users wanted to limit the results by travel time.
        %p I decided to make an interactive slider to allow the user to set the distance. Informing the user how many schools are in the chosen radius as they slide, gives helps them make a more informed decision.

        %h3 How might we present the collection of preschools in an easily digestible way?
        %p Sketching helped me figure out how to layout all the relevant information on each card. I thought that using icons would help me keep the information digestible.

        -# %p I looked to sites like Yelp and Airbnb to see how they presented information. Icons could condense much of the criteria onto a collection of cards without too much clutter.
        -# %p Navigating a large map is cumbersome. The user cares: "Is it near my home or work?", "How long will it take to get there?"
        -# %p I placed a map on each card to help the user understand exactly where the school is.

        %h3 I placed a map on each card to help the user understand exactly where the school is.

      .one-col
        %h3 Dimming, instead of removing schools helps parents understand how schools compare.
        %p The filtering menu at the top also serves as a key to the icons so the user can understand their meaning.

        %p I wanted the typography to feel warm and youthful.

        %h3 During one of the user tests, a user asked "What do the yellow and green mean?"
        %p They were referring to the background. I tried removing the yellow section, but it was really helping the sections stand out.
        %p I opted instead to blur the yellow squiggle and it worked nicely.
