<p>Whenever I have been in a life drawing class in an academic setting, I’ve always been instructed to draw standing up. On that first day of every life drawing class, I, along with everyone else, begrudgingly got up from my seat and stood next to my easel. You could see the difference in everyone’s drawings. Standing allowed us to loosen up physically and mentally. I’ve been in some life drawing classes where there’s no instructor and you can see these tiny little tight drawings. Some of them may be technically good, but they’re missing a certain quality that the drawings from standing have.</p>
<p>Recently, it’s been all the rage in the techie world to get standing desks. But even if it’s another trend that makes people feel smug and smell their own farts, it’s with good reason. <a href="http://www.onlinejacc.org/content/61/23/2346">Recent studies</a> have shown, there’s a strong correlation between sendentary behavior and health problems.</p>

<p>It’s still something I believe everyone should be doing for their health. Until Augmented reality, voice interfaces, and artificial intelligence get us to a point where we can break free from the chains of the desktop computer has created, it’s something to hedge against are declining health.</p>

<p>So yea, it’s good for your health and plenty of people have talked about that, but that isn’t why we were standing in art class. It was all about creativity. There is something about standing that unlocks those creative juices. When you stand you are in an active mindset. The blood is flowing. Your body is unrestricted. When you are sitting your body is sedentary, your mind is sedentary. And it’s not just for visual creatives. Even if you’re developing software or solving a creative business problem. The next time you're stuck problem solving. Try standing.</p>

<p>It looks sad to me whenever I see an office with rows and rows of creatives all sitting at their computer desks working independently, headphones on. You can’t even tell there is work going on from the backs of their monitors. If there is communication going on, it’s over Slack. It’s so static, so passive. Companies do manage to get a lot of creative work done this way. But I wonder what kind of innovation would happen if their employees spent a large portion of the day standing.</p>

<p>Our brains have evolved to hunt. And we didn’t outsmart our prey sitting down. I think the more freedom of movement we have, the looser we can be. For me, I’ve got a <a href="http://a.co/38SAp6O">balance board</a> that I stand on some of the time. It is fairly stable so it doesn’t take much effort to stay balanced, but allows me to rock my feet back and forth and twist and shake as I type. I personally prefer this to a treadmill desk which is just a boring rhythmic walking. I like the freedom to play with the balance board.</p>

<p>I’m not suggesting that it’s necessary to always be standing to be creative. In fact, I’ve had some very creative moments while sitting down to poop. I think that various bodily positions unlock different trains of thought. I, myself, have a desk that raises and lowers with a push of a button, and I mix it up during the day. I listen to my body and mind. If I just need to get into a hyper-focused state, I’ll lower my desk, pick out a song on the <a href="https://eternal.abimon.org/jukebox_search.html">infinite jukebox</a> and plug away.</p>

<p>Going from sitting to standing is a bit more of a discipline. I’m still that young art student who doesn’t want to get up when he’s used to sitting. My trick is to begin the day standing. And when I’m feeling restless in a standing position (which sounds weird, but it happens), I get on that balance board.</p>

<p>Another reason, I go back and forth between standing and sitting is that my back can get stiff after a while. I have a tight psoas (from sitting) creating strain on my lower back. My chiropractor showed me that standing with my legs wider than hip width and keeping my knees unlocked helps a lot. You can check this by twisting back and forth and feeling that your whole body is twisting from the ankle to the shoulder. If your knees are locked you’ll only feel the twisting from the hips up. I also recommend you learn how to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1luKAS_Xcg">sit properly</a> when you choose to.</p>

<p>Recent studies do indicate that <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/13/1/59/htm">standing desks do contribute to neurocognitive function over time</a>. But you can experiment for yourself. Mix it up. Take note of what kinds of ideas and solutions you have while standing versus sitting. Do this for your health and creativity. Or at least do it for one or the other.</p>
