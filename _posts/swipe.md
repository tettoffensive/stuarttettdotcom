### Swipe provided a frictionless way to share their photos and videos publicly.

When I joined Swipe Labs, the Swipe app was already gaining traction.

It had an easy swipe to share feature as well as an invitation system that lead to a lot of growth.

### But it's growth had slowed and retention was down.

One of the growth strategies was to bring social media influencers onto the platform to post higher quality content.

### These influx of a new type of user presented a new problem.

Many of the influencers had professional level photographs that often didn't fit the vertical format of Swipe and users couldn't see portions of the photographs.

### How could we show every photo in it's entirety in a full screen vertical format?

Several of our influencers had given us feedback when they began posting on the platform that they were not happy about their photographs being cut off.

### I explored ways in which the user could look at the whole image.

One solution was to add a gesture or a button to zoom out of the photo so it all fits in the screen.

But a button covers up more of the screen and we already had a few buttons.

A tap gesture might work, since other gestures are in use or hard to discover.

### I decided to try an idea where the user could tilt the phone from side to side to pan across the image.

I put together a prototype and showed it to the team. We ended up shipping it to production and it was a hit! It solved the problem and was a fun feature for users.
