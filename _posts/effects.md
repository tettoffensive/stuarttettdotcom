### From 2007â€“2013 I used my skills to create animated effects.

I decided to leave the VFX industry because it was becoming unstable and stagnant. I was seeking a way to grow more and I felt that technology was the place for me to do that.

### A little background into how we operated.

I was usually assigned a "shot" or a group of related "shots". My task was to come up with what the rendering and animation of a particular effect like fire would look like in a shot.

I would continue to iterate until the VFX Supervisor approved.

Then, we would show it to the Directors/Producers for final approval.

### My student reel lead to me being hired at DreamWorks.

It demonstrates how I used art and programming while in graduate school at the VizLab.
